PROBLEM : Longest Consecutive 1's
Difficulty: Easy , Company Tags : Microsoft
Given a number N. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 14 is 
1110, in which 111 is the longest 
consecutive set bits of length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: N = 222
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 222 is 
11011110, in which 1111 is the 
longest consecutive set bits of length 4. 


SOLUTION :

int helper(int n){
int maxx = 0, count = 0;
while(n > 0){
 if( n & 1 ) {
      count++;
      maxx = max(maxx , count);
                 }
 else{
     count = 0;
    }
}
return maxx;
}
